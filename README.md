# Hanoi-Tower-Solver
Solving the "Hanoi Tower" puzzle in presumably optimal way for any number of rods and disks

- hanoi_towers_solver.py is the main implementation of the algorithm.

- hanoi_towers_demo.py ios a graphical demo, it uses the "manim" library to render a video, 
The URL below provides the result for an example of a rendered video, accompanied by the Bach's "Prelude in C minor" piece,
in which I combined my passion to algorithms and music

I really hope somebody enjoys this as much as I do.

- test_hanoi_towers_solver.py is the basic set of tests for the algorithm, just to make sure that any optimization doesn't break the result.
